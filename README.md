# Reference Firmwares

This repository holds reference firmware BSP files from various official firmware and for various devices. Only notable firmwares are kept for reference purposes.

These firmwares have been used in the past as an help to work on the ARM64 port of the BSP, and may turn out to be useful again in the future.

For each, a folder dump of the core BSP files is provided (```root```), as well as a registry dump (```import.reg```) and a partial ini file for AddReg directives, directly converted from the registry dump file.
